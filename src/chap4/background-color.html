    <h2>Color Psychology</h2>
    When selecting colors, think about the psychological impact that your scheme
    will have on your users. Studies have shown that “cool” colors such as blue
    and gray evoke a sense of dependability and trust. Use these colors for a
    more business-like appearance. For pages that require a little more
    excitement, “warm” colors such as red, yellow, and orange can evoke a
    festive, fun atmosphere. For a safe, comfortable ambiance, try using brown
    and yellow. For an environmental touch, use green and brown.
