    <h1>Italic Text: <span>A History</span></h1>
    <div>
      <span>The first use of italics came in 1500</span> when Aldus Manutius of
      the Aldine Press wanted a typeface that resembled the handwritten humanist
      script that was then in common use. He asked his typecutter Francesco
      Griffo to make the typeface, which Manutius first used in the frontispiece
      of a book of the letters of Catherine of Siena. He produced the first book
      set entirely in italics the next year.
