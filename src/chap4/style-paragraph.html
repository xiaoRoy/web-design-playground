    <h1>Aligning Web Page Text</h1>
    <h2>Notes From the Field</h2>

    <div style="text-align: left">
      We read text (in English, anyway) from left to right. This means that when
      we get to the end of each line, to continue we must jump down one line and
      then scan to the beginning of that line. That leap-and-scan is most easily
      made when we "know" where the next line begins. That's why left-justified
      text is the easiest alignment to read.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: right">
      Compare the left-justified text block above with this right- justified
      paragraph. In this case, when you reach the end of each line, jumping down
      to the next isn't a problem, but because the left side of the text block
      is set ragged, the beginning of each line isn't in a predictable place,
      which makes right-justified text a tad more difficult to read.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: justify">
      Many books are set with justified paragraphs because it looks more elegant
      without the right-ragged edges. However, pro book designers use
      sophisticated layout software to manage things like hyphenation
      (particularly if the text includes a long word such as
      <i>honorificabilitudinitatibus</i>). These aren't available for the web,
      so it's often best not to justify.

      The first word of the first line is the critical word of that particular
      body of text. Let it start flush, at least. —William Addison Dwiggins

      Typographers generally take pleasure in the unpredictable length of the
      paragraph while accepting the simple and reassuring consistency of the
      paragraph indent. —Robert Bringhurst

    <div style="text-indent: -64px">
      <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Outdents</span> work well when
      dramatic effect is desired. They sometimes have a second emphasis factor,
      such as a style or case change, that contrasts with the body text.
