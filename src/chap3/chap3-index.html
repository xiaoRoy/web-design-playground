    <h2>Shortening</h2>
    <div>
        The <b>shortening</b> process is based mostly on a kind of
        linguistic laziness called <b>clipping</b> that causes us to lop
        off great chunks of words. For example, we end up with <i>fridge</i> from <i>refrigerator</i> and <em>flu</em>

        crossword-solving oldsters, from inveterate punsters to intrepid
        neologists, some aspect of language appeals to everyone.</div>

    <div>Is there one slice of the language pie that everyone likes?
        Probably not. People are just too complex to like any one thing
        universally. However, in my own admittedly limited experience (I
        haven't met every person in the world), I have yet to come across
