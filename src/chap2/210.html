    <h1>How New Words Are Created</h1>
    <strong>important text goes here</strong>

    <p>But for every word with a definite origin, there are hundreds, nay <em>thousands</em>, whose beginnings are
        unknown and probably unknowable.</p>
    <p>This <q cite="www.163.com">ordinary linguistic competence</q> manifests as various mechanisms that people use to
        forge new words:</p>

    <blockquote>
        Neology, far from being a separable linguistic phenomenon that manifests itself
        periodically or sporadically in response to social stimuli, in fact rises out of ordinary linguistic competence,
        what might be called the linguistic collective unconscious of the speech community.
