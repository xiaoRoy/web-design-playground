        I've been a professional technical writer for more than 25 years. I have
        over 90 books to my credit, which have sold more than four million
        copies worldwide. I've been building websites since 1996, so have
        intimate knowledge of HTML, CSS, and web design. My passion is to write
        books and articles to pass along that knowledge and to create tools that
        help people build awesome web pages.

        That's my work side, so what about my personal side? That is, what do I
        do in my spare time? I'm glad you asked! Here's a partial (and
        alphabetical) list of things and activities that interest me:

        <li>Dog polishing</li>
